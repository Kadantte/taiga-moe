We have a few suggestions in this regard:

1. Try running Taiga as administrator.
2. If there's a security application on your system, try whitelisting Taiga. It might be blocking Taiga from working properly.
3. Make sure Taiga is installed to its default directory (`C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Taiga`). If you have it installed under a protected directory such as *Program Files*, User Account Control may prevent Taiga from saving its settings and other data.
