As long as the site provides a consistent way to detect the anime title and the episode number in its URL or page title, it's possible. Some services such as Hulu and Netflix aren't supported because it's technically not possible to detect the episodes this way. Let us know if you have another service in mind.

Note that Taiga only supports official streaming sites. Please don't ask about direct or indirect support for unofficial ones.
