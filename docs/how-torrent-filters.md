Before checking for new torrents, you may set up some filters in order to automatically select the ones you're interested in and discard the others. Each filter consists of one or more conditions, and an action to be performed on torrents that match those conditions, such as, "if the video resolution is less than 720p, discard the torrent". It's possible to limit a filter to one or more anime in your library.

*Discard* and *Select* actions work the way you'd expect, whereas *Prefer* is a bit more complicated: If it's a general filter, torrents that don't match the filter are discarded. If it's a limited filter, torrents that match the filter are selected, and torrents that don't match the filter are discarded.

Keep in mind that:

- No torrents are selected by default.
- Filters are processed from top to bottom.
- It's not possible to select previously discarded torrents.
- It's possible to discard previously selected torrents.

There's more than one way to achieve what you want with filters. For instance, you can either select everything on your currently-watching list and then go about discarding bad fansub group names and other keywords, or you can just create a new limited filter for each anime and choose a fansub group and video resolution for it. The latter will give you more control over each title.
