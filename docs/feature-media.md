Taiga supports dozens of [media players](https://github.com/erengy/anisthesia/issues/1) including MPC-HC, mpv, PotPlayer, VLC and Kodi.

If you prefer watching anime via an official streaming service, that's okay too. Taiga supports AnimeLab, Anime Digital Network, Anime News Network, Crunchyroll, Funimation, HIDIVE, Plex Web App, Veoh, VIZ, VRV, Wakanim, Yahoo View and YouTube. This feature requires you to use one of the supported [web browsers](https://github.com/erengy/anisthesia/issues/2); namely Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera.
